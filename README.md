# DKT-console-finances
JavaScript project to demonstrate how I work with beginner knowledge.

## Description

I have created my project to demonstrate my basic knowledge of Javascript. I have used my own knowlege and researched a lot of my problems to make a solution. I have learned how to use for loops, if statements, arrays etc. Refer to the console in the Chrome dev tools to see what I have done. Refer to the code file to see the code.

## Installation

Using the live link will enable you to use this application. Right-click and then select 'inspect.' Afterwards, go to the 'console' tab. This will show you what I have printed on the console.

## Usage

Refer to the console in the Chrome dev tools to see what I have done and refer to the code file to see the code.

Below is a screenshot of my portfolio:
