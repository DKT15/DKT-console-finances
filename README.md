# DKT-console-finances

## Description

JavaScript project to demonstrate how I work with beginner knowledge.

I have created my project to demonstrate my basic knowledge of Javascript. I have used my own knowledge and researched a lot of my problems to make a solution. I have learned how to use for loops, if statements, arrays etc. Refer to the console in the Chrome dev tools to see what I have done. Refer to the code file to see the code.
